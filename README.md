Mor Training

Mor Training is the sleek, modern way to track shop tool certifications.
Students log in, pick their name, and mark off quiz and physical training completion for each tool with a single tap. Progress auto-saves to Google Sheets, and when they come back, their previous state is instantly restored — no more paper checklists or re-entering everything.

One row per student — always up to date, always accurate

Beautiful iOS-style UI — toggles, cards, and glassmorphism that feel like a native app

Mobile-first, desktop-ready — works perfectly on any device

Google Sheets backend — simple, transparent recordkeeping with zero setup hassle

Mor Training turns tool training from a messy chore into a polished, modern experience your whole team will actually enjoy using.
